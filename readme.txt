Render any HTML code without any of the theme or plugin files.

== Description ==

Render any HTML code without any of the theme or plugin files. The main benefit is that your page won't have to load any of the WordPress (theme and plugins) scripts and styles.

== Installation ==

By default it comes with a URL structure like this one: /l/pagename, you can edit the /l/ to be whatever you like in the settings page of the plugin, but remember to save the new permalink like this:

* On your admin bar (left one) go to **Settings**.
* Permalinks.
* Just click save at the bottom of the page, without making any change.

This will update the URL so you can start accesing your HTML with whatever URL you chose, like **domain.com/landings/pagename**.

## Ease of use

You just need to paste the HTML code in the editor and that's it! ðŸ¤©
